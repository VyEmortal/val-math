                    I follow these guidelines when I write. 
                    These styles are open to discussion, however; if you disagree and would like to propose an alternative, please contact me.

                    <span class="list-item"> \((1)\) </span>
                    In a list of three or more items, a comma is required after the penultimate item in the series 
                    (this is more commonly known as the "Oxford Comma.") For example, a sentence such as 
                    <i> I like A, B and C </i> must instead be punctuated as 
                    <i> I like A, B, and C</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="list-item"> \((2)\) </span>
                    A space must be inserted before a question mark if the last word is mathematical.
                    For example, a question such as 
                    <i> What is the value of \(d\)?</i> must be rewritten as 
                    <i> What is the value of \(d\) ?</i> to ensure readability.
                    However, a sentence such as 
                    <i> For what values of \(k\) is \(f(x)\) continuous?</i> does not warrant a space before the question mark because the last word is not mathematical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="list-item"> \((3)\) </span>
                    Periods and commas are to be placed inside quotation marks, unless the last word of the quoted content is mathematical, 
                    in which case the punctuation mark must be placed outside.
                    For example, the sentence 
                    <i> We will call this value "\(x_{avg}\)," as shown by … </i> is unreadable and may erect confusion. 
                    Therefore, it is best to rewrite the sentence as 
                    <i> We will call this value "\(x_{avg}\)", as shown by …</i> .
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="list-item"> \((4)\) </span>
                    Lists should be numbered using LaTeX code. 
                    Parentheses must enclose the number, with the exception of exercise numbers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="list-item"> \((5)\) </span>
                    For mathematical discussions, it is recommended to add emphasis by using the phrases 
                    <i>in order to</i> and <i>in order for</i> in place of <i>to</i> and <i>for</i>, respectively.
                    In conditional clauses, it is also recommended to add the word <i>then</i>. 
                    For example, it is recommended to write 
                    <i>If \(\sum |a_n|\) converges, then so does \(\sum a_n\) </i> 
                    instead of 
                    <i>If \(\sum |a_n|\) converges, so does \(\sum a_n\)</i>.
